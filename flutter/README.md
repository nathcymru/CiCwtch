# CiCwtch Flutter App

This is the primary Flutter application root for CiCwtch.

## Included in this starter

- `lib/main.dart` with a minimal branded application shell
- `test/widget_test.dart` for a basic widget smoke test
- `web/` assets so GitHub Actions can run `flutter build web`
- `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml`

## Important note about native wrappers

This repository pack includes a lean app starter rather than a full machine-generated Flutter project.

To generate or refresh native platform wrappers locally, run the following from inside this folder after installing Flutter:

```bash
flutter create . --platforms=android,ios,web
```

That command will preserve your existing Dart code while generating the platform-specific folders and metadata.

## Local checks

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d chrome
```
